### First, make sure that everything you need for compiling is already installed. If you follow the next steps, you'll be able to compile C and C++ code as well as others..

1) Make sure that g++/gcc compiler is installed on your system. If you're in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you'll probably need to run `sudo apt-get install g++` for this to work. 
2) The _slightly_ bloated solution is to instead run `sudo apt-get install build-essential`, which will install EVERYTHING, including the `make` command...
